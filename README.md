# Pytorch implementation of CAER 

This repository contains my implementation for the paper [**Context-Aware Emotion Recognition Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05913).

This project is created with [Pytorch-template](https://github.com/victoresque/pytorch-template) by Victor Huang. Checkout his repository for all the details.
